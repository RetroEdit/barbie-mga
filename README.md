# Barbie: Magic Genie Adventure (GBC) tools
This contains two scripts I used for [TASing](https://tasvideos.org/) the game Barbie: Magic Genie Adventure for the Game Boy Color. The current submitted TAS as of July 2023 is here: https://tasvideos.org/8403S

To use them, they both need to be loaded separately in [BizHawk's Lua console](https://tasvideos.org/Bizhawk/LuaFunctions).

One of them is a fairly basic position-display script, but the other one modifies the game to completely light up Dragon Nursery, which is normally a dark area. Normally you would use Fiera's ring to partially light it up, but in the speedrun it's faster to use another ring that doubles your movement speed.
